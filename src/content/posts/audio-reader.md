These short Japanese voice fragments feel as though they were picked up from the edge of an anime scene: a teasing call, a bright greeting, a tiny laugh, and a few lines with no clear origin. They are mood samples rather than dialogue transcripts, so let the sound carry the meaning.

Audio Reader keeps them quiet until you choose to listen. Each speaker button loads and plays its clip only after it is pressed.

```markdown
:audio-reader[Clip title]{src="/assets/audio/filename.wav"}
```

## The fragments

- **Baka**: :audio-reader[バカ]{src="/assets/audio/Baka.wav"}
- **Ciallo**: :audio-reader[Ciallo！！]{src="/assets/audio/Ciallo.wav"}
- **Ehe**: :audio-reader[A joking sense]{src="/assets/audio/Ehe.wav"}
- **Imoi**: :audio-reader[イモい]{src="/assets/audio/Imoi.wav"}
- **Zako**: :audio-reader[雑魚じゃん、雑魚雑魚]{src="/assets/audio/Zako.wav"}

`src` must use a site-root path or an HTTPS URL, and the directive label cannot be empty. Invalid or incomplete directives remain ordinary Markdown and do not load Audio Reader resources.
