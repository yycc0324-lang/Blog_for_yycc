## GitHub Repository Cards
You can add dynamic cards that link to GitHub repositories, on page load, the repository information is pulled from the GitHub API. 

::github{repo="Fabrizz/MMM-OnSpotify"}

Create a GitHub repository card with the code `::github{repo="<owner>/<repo>"}`.

```markdown
::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}
```

## Mermaid Diagrams

Fenced `mermaid` blocks are rendered as diagrams and follow the active color scheme.

## Image Widths and Captions

A standalone image accepts an optional `w-N%` width token in its alt text and a Markdown title rendered as a centered caption below the image:

![Album example image w-50%](/images/albums/AcgExample/07.webp "Half-width image with a caption")

```markdown
![Image description w-50%](./image.webp "Visible caption")
```

Valid widths range from `w-1%` to `w-100%`; invalid tokens stay in the alt text. The width and the caption are independent — a title alone also produces a caption:

![Album example image w-75%](/images/albums/AcgExample/08.webp)

![Album example image](/images/albums/AcgExample/09.webp "Caption without a width token")
