Admonitions keep supporting information visually distinct while preserving the article's reading flow. Every form is rendered on the server and uses the same compact M3E component.

## Semantic variants

::: note Deployment context
The spaced form accepts a plain custom title while remaining compatible with the reference syntax.
:::

:::info
Use information blocks for neutral context that helps readers understand the surrounding section.
:::

:::tip[Existing **label** syntax]
The original bracket label remains available and can contain inline Markdown emphasis.
:::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GitHub Alert syntax enters the same renderer, so existing articles keep one visual language.

:::warning
Check environment variables before running a production build.
:::

:::caution
Do not publish credentials, local configuration, or private keys with an example.
:::

## Optional details

::: details Inspect the complete command
The disclosure uses native browser semantics and remains keyboard accessible without client JavaScript.

```powershell
npx.cmd astro check
pnpm.cmd build
```

- It starts closed.
- Long code can scroll inside its own code block.
- The container remains within the article width on narrow screens.
